A front-end prototype for an e-commerce website named "ShopSmart," built using only pure HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates foundational web development skills in structure and styling.

## ðŸš€ Features

* **Multi-Page Layout:** A static site with multiple linked pages, including:
    * A grid-based Homepage for product categories.
    * An "About Us" page.
    * A "Your Cart" page.
    * An "Order Placed" confirmation screen.
* **Consistent Navigation:** A persistent navigation bar and footer across all pages.
* **Pure CSS Styling:** All layouts, colors, and text are styled using a custom CSS stylesheet.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Used for the structure and content of all pages.
* **CSS3:** Used for all styling, including layouts (flexbox/grid), colors, and fonts.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Purpose & Future Improvements

This project was a foundational exercise in building and styling a multi-page website from scratch using only HTML and CSS.

This static approach highlights a major challenge: scalability. For example, to have 30 different products, this project would require 30 separate, hard-coded HTML files.

As a key learning, **if we use JavaScript, we can make it far simpler and with very less files.** The clear next step for this project is to introduce JavaScript to dynamically generate product pages from a single template, making the site efficient and maintainable.
